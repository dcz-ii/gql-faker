# This is sample IDL schema for GraphQL Faker
# This schema describes simple API with two entities
#
# There are two directives you can use to enhance fake data:
#
#   - @fake
#   - @examples
#
# Each directive has autocompletion working so just press @
#
# Press save or Cmd+Enter to save the results and update the server
#
# Switch to GraphiQL on the right panel to immidiatelly test your changes
# This tool also supports extending existing APIs. Check out our repository for details.
