# This is sample IDL schema for GraphQL Faker in extend mode
#
# In this mode Faker leverages IDL extend keyword. Here is an example of how to add
# a few extra fields to type Person
#
# extend type Person {
#   petName: String
#   petImg: String
# }
#
# ALso you can use following two directives to enhance fake data:
#
#   - @fake
#   - @examples
#
# For example:
#
# extend type Person {
#   petName: String @fake(type: firstName)
#   petImg: String @fake(type:avatarUrl, options:{imageWidth: 200, imageHeight: 400})
# }
#
# Each directive has autocompletion working so just press @
#
# Press save or Cmd+Enter to save the schema and update the server
#
# Switch to GraphiQL on the right panel to immidiatelly test your changes
